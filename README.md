Day 1 Reflection:
I am definitely more comfortable with Python and NumPy after completing this activity. I feel like I understand the syntax and how to use the libraries better. I also enjoyed using Github and think it is a great way to share code and collaborate with others. I am looking forward to using it more in the future.

Day 2 Reflection:
In this module, we learned about some basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts and models. We also had the opportunity to practice developing ML models. I found the module to be very helpful in understanding the basics of ML.
The module was organized in a great manner; It started with the basics of ML and then gradually built up to more complex concepts. This allowed me to better understand the material and to build my skills in a step-by-step manner. I also found the practical exercises to be very helpful. These exercises gave me the opportunity to put what I had learned into practice and to further develop my skills. Overall, I found this module to be very beneficial and I am looking forward to learning more about ML in the future.

Day 3  Reflection:
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain. These algorithms are used to learn high-level abstractions from data. Deep learning is a relatively new field that has seen tremendous growth in recent years.
I found Intro To Deep Learning to be a very interesting and informative course. I enjoyed learning about the different algorithms used in deep learning and how they can be applied to various tasks. I also found the course to be very well organized and easy to follow. 

Day 4 Reflection:
I found TensorFlow to be a very interesting and powerful tool for machine learning. It allows for the creation of very complex models and can be used for a variety of tasks. I enjoyed learning about the different types of models that can be created with TensorFlow and how they can be used to solve different problems. I also found it helpful to see how TensorFlow can be used to improve existing machine learning models. Overall, I found this to be a very informative and useful tool for machine learning.

Day 5 Reflection:
Neural networks are a powerful tool for machine learning, and they are widely used in a variety of applications. I have a basic understanding of how they work, and I was able to build a simple neural network model using the TensorFlow library. I found that the most challenging part of working with neural networks was understanding all of the different parameters and settings that are available. I found it helpful to read about the different types of neural networks and to experiment with different settings in order to find what worked best for my data. Overall, I am pleased with my understanding of neural networks and I look forward to using them in future projects.

Day 6 Reflection:
One of the things that I found most interesting about neural networks is that the more data you have, the better they tend to perform. This is due to the fact that neural networks are able to learn patterns from data, and the more data they have, the more they can learn. This is why convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tend to be very effective at image recognition. The downside of this is that CNNs can be very data hungry; they need a lot of data to learn from in order to be effective. This can be a problem when trying to train a CNN on a small dataset. In my experience, it is often better to use a smaller CNN rather than a larger one when working with small datasets. Overall, this lesson was very helpful in understanding convolutional neural networks. I found the explanations of how the networks work to be very clear, and I appreciated the opportunity to experiment with different model evaluation metrics. I also found it interesting to see how the size of the training data affects the model's predictive power. Now, I feel like I have a much better understanding of CNNs after completing this lesson.

Day 7 Reflection:
In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the potential for algorithmic bias in AI-based software. This is due to the fact that AI-based software is often used to make decisions that can have a significant impact on people's lives. For example, AI-based software is frequently used to determine things like credit scores and insurance rates. If these algorithms are biased, it can result in real-world inequalities and biases.
There are a number of reasons why algorithmic bias can occur in AI-based software. One reason is that the data that is used to train the algorithms can be biased. For example, if the data set used to train a credit scoring algorithm is biased, then the algorithm will be biased. Another reason is that the algorithms themselves can be biased. This can happen if the people who design the algorithms have personal biases that they inadvertently introduce into the algorithms.
The effects of algorithmic bias can be significant. For example, if an algorithm is biased against certain groups of people, it can result in those groups of people being denied access to credit or insurance. This can have a negative impact on their ability to improve their financial situation. Additionally, algorithmic bias can reinforce and amplify existing societal inequalities. For example, if an algorithm is biased against low-income people, it can make it harder for them to get out of poverty.
Overall, it is important to be aware of the potential for algorithmic bias in AI-based software. This is because it can have a significant impact on people's lives. If you are using AI-based software, you should be aware of the potential for bias and take steps to avoid it.

Day 8 Reflection:
When it comes to layers in a CNN architecture, there are definitely a few different types that play key roles in the function of the network. The first layer is typically the input layer, which is responsible for taking in the raw data that will be fed into the network. This data is then passed through a series of hidden layers, which are responsible for processing the data and extracting features from it. Finally, the output layer is responsible for producing the results of the network, which can be classification labels or predictions.
Each of these layers plays a vital role in the function of the network, and different architectures can have different numbers of each type of layer. For example, some networks may have more hidden layers in order to extract more features from the data, while others may have fewer hidden layers and rely more on the output layer to produce results.
Ultimately, it is the combination of all of these layers that makes CNNs so powerful. By working together, they are able to take in raw data and turn it into useful information that can be used to make predictions or classification decisions.

Day 9 Reflection:
I was introduced to loss functions in the past but this assignment helped me really hone in on my understanding. I was figuiring out how different models can be evaluated and compared, and how loss functions are a key part of that process. Loss functions allow us to quantify how well (or poorly) a model is performing, and they can be used to optimize models by minimizing the error. I found this concept to be very interesting, and it has since helped me better understand and evaluate machine learning models.

Day 10 Reflection:
Activation functions are used in artificial neural networks to determine whether a neuron should be activated or not. There are a variety of activation functions, but the most common are the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU functions. I found activation functions to be fascinating because they are what allow neural networks to learn and make predictions. Without activation functions, neural networks would be much less effective.

Day 11 Reflection:
There are a number of ways that one can engage with ethical thinking while practicing ML and AI. One way is to think about the potential implications of the algorithms that are being used. For example, if a gender classification algorithm is being used, what are the potential implications of using this algorithm? Another way to engage with ethical thinking is to think about the data that is being used to train the algorithms. For example, if the data is biased, then the algorithm is likely to be biased as well. Finally, it is also important to think about the ways in which the algorithm might be used in the future. For example, if the algorithm is going to be used to make decisions about hiring, then it is important to consider whether or not the algorithm is likely to be biased against certain groups of people.

Day 12 Reflection:
I have learned how to perform Image Classification using Machine Learning. As humans, we can recognize a person by his/her face by just meeting them once, and the same is desirable by computers because many times data is at a minimum. I have learned that in order to achieve this, we need to use a supervised learning algorithm. This will enable the computer to "learn" from a set of labeled images. After the computer has "learned" from this set of images, it can then be applied to a new set of images (the test set) and be able to classify them correctly.

Day 13 Reflection:
Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, where a model performs well on training data but does not generalize well to new data. This can be mitigated with regularization, which is a technique that penalizes complex models in order to prevent overfitting.

Day 14 Reflection:
I was able to complete the objectives of familiarizing myself with upsampling and downsampling, as well as introducing myself to autoencoders. I found the concepts to be interesting and beneficial to my understanding of machine learning. Overall, I enjoyed learning about these topics and feel that I have a better understanding of them now.
