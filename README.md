# FutureMakers2022

Day 1 Reflection:
I am definitely more comfortable with Python and NumPy after completing this activity. I feel like I understand the syntax and how to use the libraries better. I also enjoyed using Github and think it is a great way to share code and collaborate with others. I am looking forward to using it more in the future.

Day 2 Reflection:
In this module, we learned about some basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts and models. We also had the opportunity to practice developing ML models. I found the module to be very helpful in understanding the basics of ML.
The module was organized in a great manner; It started with the basics of ML and then gradually built up to more complex concepts. This allowed me to better understand the material and to build my skills in a step-by-step manner. I also found the practical exercises to be very helpful. These exercises gave me the opportunity to put what I had learned into practice and to further develop my skills. Overall, I found this module to be very beneficial and I am looking forward to learning more about ML in the future.

Day 3  Reflection:
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain. These algorithms are used to learn high-level abstractions from data. Deep learning is a relatively new field that has seen tremendous growth in recent years.
I found Intro To Deep Learning to be a very interesting and informative course. I enjoyed learning about the different algorithms used in deep learning and how they can be applied to various tasks. I also found the course to be very well organized and easy to follow. 

Day 4 Reflection:
I found TensorFlow to be a very interesting and powerful tool for machine learning. It allows for the creation of very complex models and can be used for a variety of tasks. I enjoyed learning about the different types of models that can be created with TensorFlow and how they can be used to solve different problems. I also found it helpful to see how TensorFlow can be used to improve existing machine learning models. Overall, I found this to be a very informative and useful tool for machine learning.

Day 5 Reflection:
Neural networks are a powerful tool for machine learning, and they are widely used in a variety of applications. I have a basic understanding of how they work, and I was able to build a simple neural network model using the TensorFlow library. I found that the most challenging part of working with neural networks was understanding all of the different parameters and settings that are available. I found it helpful to read about the different types of neural networks and to experiment with different settings in order to find what worked best for my data. Overall, I am pleased with my understanding of neural networks and I look forward to using them in future projects.
