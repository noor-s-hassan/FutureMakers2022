# FutureMakers2022

Day 1 Reflection:
I am definitely more comfortable with Python and NumPy after completing this activity. I feel like I understand the syntax and how to use the libraries better. I also enjoyed using Github and think it is a great way to share code and collaborate with others. I am looking forward to using it more in the future.

Day 2 Reflection:
In this module, we learned about some basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts and models. We also had the opportunity to practice developing ML models. I found the module to be very helpful in understanding the basics of ML.
The module was organized in a great manner; It started with the basics of ML and then gradually built up to more complex concepts. This allowed me to better understand the material and to build my skills in a step-by-step manner. I also found the practical exercises to be very helpful. These exercises gave me the opportunity to put what I had learned into practice and to further develop my skills. Overall, I found this module to be very beneficial and I am looking forward to learning more about ML in the future.
